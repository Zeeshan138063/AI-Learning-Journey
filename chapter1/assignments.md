# Types Of Artificial Intelligence

## 1. Based on Capabilities

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
This type of AI is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car). Most current AI systems, including those that can play complex games like chess and Go, fall under this category. They operate under a limited pre-defined range or set of contexts.

### General AI (Strong AI)
A type of AI endowed with broad human-like cognitive capabilities, enabling it to tackle new and unfamiliar tasks autonomously. Such a robust AI framework possesses the capacity to discern, assimilate, and utilize its intelligence to resolve any challenge without needing human guidance.

### Superintelligent AI
This represents a future form of AI where machines could surpass human intelligence across all fields, including creativity, general wisdom, and problem-solving. Superintelligence is speculative and not yet realized.

## 2. Based on Functionalities

### Reactive Machines
These AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions. They analyze and respond to different situations. IBM's Deep Blue, which beat Garry Kasparov at chess, is an example.

### Limited Memory
These AI systems can make informed and improved decisions by studying the past data they have collected. Most present-day AI applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars, fall into this category.

### Theory of Mind
This is a more advanced type of AI that researchers are still working on. It would entail understanding and remembering emotions, beliefs, needs, and depending on those, making decisions. This type requires the machine to understand humans truly.

### Self-aware AI
This represents the future of AI, where machines will have their own consciousness, sentience, and self-awareness. This type of AI is still theoretical and would be capable of understanding and possessing emotions, which could lead them to form beliefs and desires.
