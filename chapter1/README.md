# Stemming and Lemmatization in Python

## Stemming
Stemming is a process that stems or removes last few characters from a word, often leading to incorrect meanings and spelling


## Lemmatisation 
 
Lemmatization considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, which is called Lemma.
